    "Inspect current Memory-OS runtime diagnostics only when the user "
    "explicitly asks for current architecture, provider/backend, status, "
    "health, Hindsight canonical-store role, or exact counts. Do not use "
    "for ordinary chat, opinions, feelings, design discussion, or broad "
    "questions such as whether the memory system feels useful. Returns "
    "counts and storage facts without raw private bodies. Treat this tool "
    "as authoritative for current provider diagnostics, not historical recall."
)

MEMORY_OS_REVIEW_REPLY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Apply a Memory-OS owner review action after the Hermes agent has "
    "understood the owner's interactive approval intent. Use structured "
    "arguments only: action=`approve|reject|revoke|allow|feedback|apply` plus action_token="
    "`oa_<token>` and, for feedback, rating. Do not send a free-form command "
    "string. Use only when the latest owner message clearly asks to apply a "
    "specific owner review token, or after the agent has clarified the target. "
    "Call the tool for every new explicit owner token message, including repeated "
    "tokens, so Memory-OS can return idempotent duplicate/already-applied evidence; "
    "do not answer from prior chat history alone. "
    "Do not use for ordinary chat, questions about Memory-OS, messages that "
    "merely mention a token, display anchors such as A1/R1 without resolving "
    "the matching token, or broad approval language without a confirmed oa_ "
    "action token. The tool routes through OwnerActionProcessor and never "
    "sends, executes work, writes identity, or approves crystallized memory "
    "without the matching owner action token."
)

MEMORY_OS_REVIEW_SURFACE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Read bounded Memory-OS owner-review surface data for Hermes agent "
    "conversation. Use when the owner asks for more review items, next page, "
    "an item detail such as '展开 R3', approved-proposal follow-up status, "
    "feedback context for the latest right-brain expression outcome, or "
    "feedback context for latest MemorySources recall/context quality. "
    "This tool is read-only: it never approves, rejects, sends, executes, "
    "writes identity, or writes crystallized memory. Hermes agent owns the "
    "Chinese explanation, pagination wording, and clarifying questions. "
    "Use memory_os_review_reply separately only after the owner gives a "
    "specific stable oa_ action token and clear action intent, including "
    "a separate apply intent for approved-proposal follow-up items."
